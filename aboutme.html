<h3>Hi! I am Wan Yie!</h3>
<p>Nice to meet you all and thank you for visiting my page. Let me introduce myself. My name is Wan Yie and I'am an IT student at Swinburne University of Technology Sarawak Campus. I am actually a person who like to listen K-Pop music and have my favourite artist. One day, my friend and I talked about it during our chat. And both of us think that it will be more easy for the new fans to know their favourite artist if there is a website shows all things of that artist. From then on, I have decided to create a website for my favourite artist, Winwin from NCT. Through this website, everyone can see all of his information, included his profile, the music video recorded by him, and his photocards taken before. By visiting this site, I hope to introduce him to a broader audience and convenience his fans.</p>
